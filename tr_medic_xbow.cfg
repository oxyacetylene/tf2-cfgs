// Default configuration parameters for the map entities are provided in tr_medic_xbow_defaults.cfg
// by default the alias "load_config" is set to exec this config, however difficultly settings may change this.

// The following g_spawn variables control which exercise you will spawn at when the map loads.  
// One, and only one, should be set to 1.  All others should be 0

global_set g_spawn_at_air 1 // change this to 1 and all others to 0, and you will spawn at air shot exercise
global_set g_spawn_at_hill 1 // change this to 1 and all others to 0, and you will spawn at air shot exercise

global_set g_disable_skybots 1 // comment this line to add skybots

global_set g_disable_spawn_hill_bots 0 // change to zero to disable bots spawning on the hill
global_set g_disable_spawn_house_bots 0 // change to zero to disable bots spawning in the brick house
global_set g_disable_spawn_battle_bots 0  // change to zero to disable bots fighting for the control points in the background

// You cannot put entity modifying commands in this script (ent_fire, etc)
// After the map has loaded, all entities are reset when a new round begins
