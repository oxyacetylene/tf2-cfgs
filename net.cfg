// Net settings
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Whilst net settings perhaps aren't an integral part of an FPS config, they
// are a fact of life in competitive TF2, and as such, they are included here.
//
// A common question I am asked -- what defines whether a good connection is
// good or bad? Mostly personal preference. If you're not willing to make the
// choice, try both and see which is better for you.
//
// Generally, meeting both of the following conditions would classify it as a
// good connection:
//
// - Ping of <80 to the average server you join
// - Generally no/negligible choke/loss (can be checked with `net_graph')
//
// There's some pretty good documentation on this here:
// http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_Networking
//
// Uncomment (remove the `//' from) one of the groups if you want to use them.
